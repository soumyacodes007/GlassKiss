# Glasskiss

**Glasskiss is an Ephemeral Break-Glass Access Controller. It turns 'Permanent Production Access' (a huge security risk) into 'Just-in-Time Scoped Access' using Motia’s durable primitives.**

---

## ⚡ Limitless Liability: The Current State of Access

✦ **The Ticking Time Bomb**
Every engineering team has a dirty secret: Permanent SSH keys and database credentials sitting on developer laptops—just one stolen device away from a total data breach.

✦ **Manual Failure**
Most "Break-Glass" systems rely on humans to remember to revoke access. But humans forget, scripts fail, and "temporary" access often becomes permanent liability.

✦ **Compliance Nightmare**
SOC2 and HIPAA audits don't just want logs of what happened; they want proof that you couldn't do the wrong thing. Static credentials are an audit failure waiting to happen.

✦ **Broad Access**
Traditional access is "all or nothing." You need to fix one row, but you're given the keys to the entire kingdom. The blast radius is catastrophic.

---

## 🛡️ The Solution

Glasskiss leverages Motia's powerful primitives to create a **fail-closed**, **auditable**, and **time-limited** access control system.

◈ **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Credentials exist only when needed and expire automatically.
◈ **Zero-Trust Enforcement**: Default deny. Access is granted explicitly for specific scopes.
◈ **Immutable Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of every action and policy decision.
◈ **Automated Revocation**: Durable timers ensure access is removed even if systems restart.

## 💎 Enterprise Features

### 1. AI-Powered Scope Extraction

Traditional break-glass workflows grant broad access for narrow problems. GlassKiss employs an AI Agent to parse natural language intent into strict SQL policies.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["Request"]
        A["'Fix billing for user #123'"]
    end

    subgraph AI["AI Processing Agent"]
        B[Entity Extraction]
        C[Table Detection]
        D[Operation Inference]
    end

    subgraph Output["Enforced Policy"]
        E["tables: [users, billing]<br/>entities: [user:123]<br/>operations: [SELECT, UPDATE]"]
    end

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E

    style Input fill:#fff,stroke:#000,color:#000
    style AI fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#b91c1c,color:#000
    style Output fill:#111,stroke:#000,color:#fff
```

**Observer Pattern Strategy**: The AI component acts strictly as a parser, translating intent into configuration. It effectively places the LLM in a sandbox where its output is validated before application, ensuring deterministic enforcement.

### 2. Blast Radius Control

Proactive prevention of catastrophic errors through pre-execution analysis. Most security tools are reactive; Glasskiss is proactive.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Query["SQL Command"]
        A["DELETE FROM users;"]
    end

    subgraph Checks["Policy Guardrails"]
        B{WHERE Present?}
        C{Table Permitted?}
        D{Operation Allowed?}
        E{Row Limit Safe?}
    end

    subgraph Result["Enforcement Decision"]
        G["BLOCKED (403 Forbidden)"]
        H["ALLOWED (Execute)"]
    end

    A --> B
    B -->|No| G
    B -->|Yes| C
    C -->|No| G
    C -->|Yes| D
    D -->|No| G
    D -->|Yes| E
    E -->|No| G
    E -->|Yes| H

    style Query fill:#fff,stroke:#000,color:#000
    style Checks fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#b91c1c,color:#000
    style G fill:#b91c1c,stroke:#b91c1c,color:#fff
    style H fill:#111,stroke:#000,color:#fff
```

**Enforcement Rules:**
✓ **Critical**: DELETE/UPDATE operations require WHERE clauses.
✓ **High**: Operations restricted to approved tables and entity IDs.
✓ **Medium**: Maximum row impact limits based on request scope.

### 3. Durable Revocation

Leveraging Motia's durable timers, revocation is guaranteed regardless of system restarts or failures.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GK as Glasskiss
    participant Timer as Durable Timer
    participant DB as Database

    Dev->>GK: Request Access (30m)
    GK->>DB: CREATE USER temp_user
    GK->>Timer: Schedule Revocation (+30m)
    Note over Timer: System Restart / Failure
    Timer-->>Timer: State Persisted (Survivable)
    Timer->>GK: Trigger Revocation
    GK->>DB: DROP USER temp_user
    GK->>Dev: Notify Expiration
```

### 4. Real-Time Compliance Streaming

All activities, from approval workflows to individual SQL queries, are streamed in real-time to the Motia Workbench.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Source["Event Sources"]
        A[User Actions]
        B[Policy Decisions]
        C[System Events]
    end

        D[High-Throughput Ingestion]
    end

    subgraph Sinks["Compliance Consumers"]
        E[Workbench Dashboard]
        F[SIEM Collector]
        G[Audit Archive]
    end

    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    D --> G

    style Source fill:#fff,stroke:#000,color:#000
    style Stream fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#b91c1c,color:#000
    style Sinks fill:#111,stroke:#000,color:#fff
```

### 5. Interactive Slack Approval Workflow

Seamless ChatOps integration allowing security teams to approve or reject requests without context switching.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Request["Access Request"]
        A["Request: prod_db access"]
    end

    subgraph Slack["Slack Interface"]
        B["Rich Message Block<br/>Risk Score: High"]
        C{Approver Action}
    end

    subgraph Outcome["System Action"]
        D["Provision Credentials"]
        E["Reject & Notify"]
    end

    A --> B --> C
    C -->|Approve Button| D
    C -->|Reject Button| E

    style Request fill:#fff,stroke:#000,color:#000
    style Slack fill:#111,stroke:#000,color:#fff
    style Outcome fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#b91c1c,color:#000
```

### 6. AI-Generated Audit Reports

Automated generation of human-readable compliance logs after every session.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Data["Session Telemetry"]
        A[Command Logs]
        B[Policy Violations]
        C[Access Duration]
    end

    subgraph AI["AI Auditor Agent"]
        D[Contextual Analysis]
        E[Summarization]
    end

    subgraph Report["Compliance Artifact"]
        F["Final Audit Report"]
    end

    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> E --> F

    style Data fill:#fff,stroke:#000,color:#000
    style AI fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#b91c1c,color:#000
    style Report fill:#111,stroke:#000,color:#fff

## 🔒 Enterprise Security Posture

Glasskiss is designed with a **Security-First** mindset, moving beyond simple automation to rigorous enforcement.

◈ **Fail-Closed Architecture**: Any failure in the risk analysis or provisioning chain results in a default denial of access.
◈ **Identity-First Guardrails**: Mandatory multi-party approval for high-risk resources ensures no single point of internal failure.
◈ **Immutable Execution Logs**: Real-time streaming to the Motia Workbench provides a tamper-proof record for forensic audits.
◈ **Zero-Trust SQL Enforcement**: The first of its kind to enforce row-level intent at the proxy layer, not just the network layer.

---

## 🚀 2025 Vision & Roadmap

The journey toward total ephemeral infrastructure is just beginning.

✦ **M-of-N Approval Matrix**: Flexible approval logic (e.g., 2 SREs OR 1 Security Engineer).
✦ **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Integration with GitHub/Slack activity to adjust risk points in real-time.
✦ **Pre-Calculated Blast Radius**: Visual prediction of affected rows before a user commits a query.
✦ **SIEM Auto-Ingestion**: Native connectors for Splunk, Datadog, and Panther.
